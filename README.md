# Exercise-Map
This was a a project on a JS Udemy course.

HTML and CSS was provided for this project so as to allow the focus to be on  practicing JS however, there was some manipulation of the HTML as part of the project. 

Features of the app include:
- Use of local storage of workout data.
- Popups for incorrect data entry (where non-numerical values or numbers less than 1 were entered).
- Use of geolocation to show the map of where the user is.
- Use of the Leaflet library.
- Map will move to centre on the historical workout selected from the side bar.
- Selecting the appropriate marker on the map based on if the workout is running or cycling.
